#+title: Notes on my first Eurorack VCO
#+date: <2022-12-20 Tue>

- based on [[http://web.archive.org/web/20220120221542/http://www.djerickson.com/synth/][Dave Erickson's design]]

* Parts

- opamp, ota from the reference
- had to look for a new matched transistor pair
  - even Mouser did not have SSM2220 and PM5201
  - [[DMMT3906W][DMMT3906W]] seem to be a good replacement are in stock (and plenty)
    - apparently based on the 2N3906
  - transistor pairs with a specified matching seem to be rare
  - metrics:
    - matching â‰¤2% (10% is more common)
    - current gain in the ballpark of a 2N3906
      - a high current gain would lead to a small base current and therefore a worse SNR (?)
  - SOT363 is pretty much unavoidable

* Changes

- only one CV in (keeping the module minimal)
