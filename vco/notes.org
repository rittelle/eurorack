#+title: Notes on my first Eurorack VCO
#+date: <2022-12-31 Sat>

- based on [[http://web.archive.org/web/20220120221542/http://www.djerickson.com/synth/][Dave Erickson's design]]

* Parts

- opamp, ota from the reference
- had to look for a new matched transistor pair
  - even Mouser did not have SSM2220 and PM5201
  - [[DMMT3906W][DMMT3906W]] seem to be a good replacement are in stock (and plenty)
    - apparently based on the 2N3906
  - transistor pairs with a specified matching seem to be rare
  - metrics:
    - matching ≤2% (10% is more common)
    - current gain in the ballpark of a 2N3906
      - a high current gain would lead to a small base current and therefore a worse SNR (?)
  - SOT363 is pretty much unavoidable

* Changes

- only one CV in (keeping the module minimal)
- sine output correction
- inverted saw wave output (for a lfo variant)
- added an led to indicate lfo activity
- polarity protection
- substituted the matched transistor pair
- added a switch for a lfo mode

* Front panel

- Aluminium core PCB as front panel
- KiCad is not well suited for panel design
- Switched to Inkscape

** Workflow

1. Place mounting holes in the Schematic
2. Export the drill file as .svg (check the unit settings!)
3. Import the .svg into Inkscape
4. Design the panel
5. Export the panel as a .png with a high DPI setting (≥512dpi)
6. Use KiCads Bitmap to Component-Converter to convert the .png
7. Adjust the level setting if needed
8. Copy the footprint into the clipboard
9. Paste it into the Layout
10. Verify that the quality is acceptable
11. Integrate the panel design
12. When exporting to gerber, disable the component markings in the export dialog

* Buy List
